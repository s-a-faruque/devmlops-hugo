---

#### Prerequisites

## Step 1: Install Hugo
### Windows
1. Download the latest Hugo release from [GitHub](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded file and add the Hugo binary to your system PATH.
3. Verify installation by running:
   ```sh
   hugo version
   ```

### macOS (Using Homebrew)
```sh
brew install hugo
```

### Linux (Using Snap)
```sh
sudo snap install hugo --classic
```

---

## Step 2: Create a New Hugo Site
Run the following command to create a new Hugo site:
```sh
hugo new site myblog
```
This creates a `myblog` directory with the basic Hugo structure.

---

## Step 3: Choose and Install a Theme
Hugo has a variety of themes available at [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/). Install a theme by cloning it into the `themes` directory.

Example (using Ananke theme):
```sh
cd myblog
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
```
Then, update `config.toml` to use the theme:
```toml
theme = "ananke"
```

---

## Step 4: Create Your First Blog Post
To create a new post, run:
```sh
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```
Edit the `content/posts/my-first-post.md` file, updating the title, date, and content. Set `draft: false` to make it visible.

---

## Step 5: Run the Local Server
Start a local server to preview your blog:
```sh
hugo server -D
```
Visit `http://localhost:1313/` in your browser to see your site.

---

## Step 6: Build and Deploy Your Blog
Generate the static site by running:
```sh
hugo
```
This creates a `public/` directory with the HTML files. You can deploy it to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Initialize a Git repository in the `public` folder:
   ```sh
   cd public
git init
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Hugo site"
git push -u origin main
   ```

### Deploy to Netlify (Recommended)
1. Create a repository for your Hugo project on GitHub.
2. Push your entire Hugo project (not just `public/`) to GitHub.
3. Connect the repository to Netlify.
4. Set the build command to `hugo` and publish directory to `public`.
5. Deploy the site!
