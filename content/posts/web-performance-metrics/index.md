## Website Performance Metrics in 3 Steps

Delivering a fast, responsive, and engaging website isn’t magic — it’s about understanding what to measure and when. Here’s a simple 3-step framework that aligns your performance metrics with the real user journey.

---

### Step 1: Load Speed — “How Fast Does It Start?”

This is the first impression. The page hasn’t done anything yet — but how quickly it begins matters.

**Metrics to Track:**
- **TTFB (Time To First Byte):** How fast your server sends the first byte of data.
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint):** When the browser displays the first visible element.
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** When the main content finishes rendering.

**Goal:** Make users see something useful — fast.

---

### Step 2: Interactivity — “How Quickly Can I Use It?”

Seeing content is one thing — being able to interact without lag or jank is another.

**Metrics to Track:**
- **TTI (Time To Interactive):** When your page is fully usable.
- **INP (Interaction to Next Paint):** Measures how fast the UI responds to user input.
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** Checks for layout shifts that disrupt user experience.

**Goal:** Make the experience smooth, stable, and frustration-free.

### Step 3: Engagement — “Did It Feel Good Enough to Stay?”

Once the site is usable, we measure whether users stay, explore, and engage.

**Metrics to Track:**
- **Time on Page:** Are users spending time reading or interacting?
- **Bounce Rate:** Are they leaving after just one page?

**Goal:** Create a delightful experience that keeps users coming back.

**Pro Tip:** Pair this framework with real monitoring tools like [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/), or [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to get real data and recommendations.

Now you know why some websites feel faster — and how you can make yours one of them.
