In software development, version control is crucial for tracking changes and collaborating effectively. Git, one of the most widely used version control systems, allows developers to commit changes with messages that describe what was modified. However, without a proper structure, commit messages can become inconsistent, unclear, or even useless.

A Git Commit Convention provides a standardized way to write commit messages, making them more readable, understandable, and useful for developers, reviewers, and future maintainers.

Why Follow a Git Commit Convention?

Using a commit convention brings several benefits:
	•	Clarity: Well-structured messages help team members quickly understand the changes.
	•	Consistency: A standard format ensures uniformity across the repository.
	•	Automation: Tools like commit linting, changelog generation, and CI/CD pipelines can leverage structured commits.
	•	Better History: Easier debugging and version tracking.

Common Git Commit Conventions

1. Conventional Commits

Conventional Commits is a widely adopted standard that structures commit messages using a specific format:

<type>(<scope>): <subject>

	•	<type>: Specifies the nature of the change (e.g., feat, fix, docs).
	•	<scope> (optional): Indicates the part of the project affected.
	•	<subject>: A brief summary of the change.

Example Commit Messages:

feat(auth): add Google OAuth support
fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions

Common Types:

Type	Purpose
feat	Introduces a new feature
fix	Fixes a bug
docs	Updates documentation
style	Changes that do not affect code functionality (e.g., formatting, linting)
refactor	Code restructuring without changing functionality
test	Adds or modifies tests
chore	Maintenance tasks (e.g., updating dependencies)
perf	Performance improvements

2. Angular Commit Convention

The Angular Commit Convention follows a similar structure and is the foundation of Conventional Commits. It has an additional body and footer section for detailed descriptions:

<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>

Example:

feat(auth): implement password reset

Users can now reset their passwords using a verification code sent via email.

BREAKING CHANGE: This removes the old password recovery method.

Conclusion

Following a Git Commit Convention improves collaboration, maintainability, and automation in software projects. Whether using Conventional Commits, Angular Convention, or Gitmoji, adopting a structured approach ensures that commit history remains clean and useful.

If you’re working in a team, consider enforcing a convention with commit linting and hooks to maintain code quality and consistency.
